function best = autogen(genestart, popsize, demesize, fitnessfunc, recombinationrate, mutationrate, tournamentcount, multistart, mutatefunc)
% Algorithm from: The Microbial Genetic Algorithm, Inman Harvey, 1996
% There exists a single-line version, see "Evolvable Neuronal Paths: A Novel Basis for Information and Search in the Brain", 2011, Fernando C, Vasas V, SzathmÃ¡ry E, Husbands P. PLoS ONE 6(8): e23534. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023534
%
% This is a minimal implementation with multistart and such but no optimization otherwise. See autogen.m for a more elaborate (and generalized) version, or mga_imatrix in autoreorient.m for a tailored version for a specific application (head reorientation).
